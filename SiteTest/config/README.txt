Hello Grader,

Please place the unzipped HW4 file in your htdocs directory inside XAMPP.
If you are using XAMPP I don't think you'd need to change anything. Just run the XAMP manager and start all. 

Then navigate to localhost/HW4/.

If you are not using XAMPP please change the path for $longURL to the directory you put the folder (HW4) in.

Then navigate to localhost/HW3/ in your browser.



Thanks,
Jamie and Zohaib
